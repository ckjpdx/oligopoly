## Concept
Oligopoly's game-flow reflects the cycles of capitalism on a society depending on government policy. In this game you play a sociopathic business person who's perspective on the economy is that of a person playing a game: more money, higher score, at any cost. Unstable but lucrative libertarian policy versus stable but costly socialistic policy. When libertarian ideas dictate policy, "contributions" to deregulate certain industries are possible, making the game economy experiences a surge of prosperity followed by a sudden crash. It's this building up frantically and the inevitable crash that the game revolves around:

* There are 3 stages the market can be in: booming, stable, recession. Once an industry type is deregulated it starts "booming" which is always followed eventually by a "recession".
* When a conservative policy is in place there is a higher chance of the "nation" being at war. The war status of the nation affects certain industries: arms and robotics receive a boost in demand, while medicine and energy receive a boost in peacetime.
* Like a binging addict, a society experiencing a recession will attempt to correct itself by electing moderate or socialistic policy makers in order to stabilize. However, ambitious people will forget the last recession in time and soon favor more libertarian policy, frustrated with government regulations standing between them and their dream to own vastly more than their fellow citizens.
* Facilities can be upgraded but not downgraded - only destroyed.
* Personnel will need to be hired on as the economy expands, and fired when an economy contracts.

The trick of this game will be to make the most of the boom-bust cycle, expanding and contracting your corporation as needed to scale to current need until you become a "super-corp" and are considered "too big to fail", making you immune to bankruptcy and giving to license to recklessly undersell competition until all rivals are eradicated.

*Remember: as the CEO, the lives of the families affected by this process are not your concern. You have bigger fish to fry and illegally imported cigars to chomp.*
